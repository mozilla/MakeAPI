##Tagging##

There are 3 types of tags that can be applied to makes. Each tag requires specific levels of authentication, which will be described below.

**Raw Tags**

Raw tags can be applied by any user, and can be prefixed by a '#'.

I.E.
\#Awesome
WebLiteracy
very-cool

**User Tags**

User tags are the only prefix that a regular webmaker user can apply to a tag. The separator for a prefixed tag is a colon ':'

I.E.
webmaker@domain.com:favourite
webmaker2@domain.com:myawesomelist

**Application tags**

These tags are reserved for trusted apps (with the exception that an admin webmaker can add them)

I.E.
webmaker.org:featured
popcorn.webmaker.org:project
thimble.webmaker.org:tutorial
